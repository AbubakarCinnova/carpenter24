                                    <h3>What are VOCs?</h3>
                                    <p>Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) are gases emitted from indoor sources like
                                        building materials and cleaning products, posing health risks such as eye
                                        irritation and respiratory issues. Long-term exposure can even increase cancer
                                        risk. To reduce exposure, opt for low-VOC products, improve ventilation, and use
                                        air purifiers with activated carbon filters and UV-C light technology, such as
                                        the Healthy Climate® In-Duct Air Purifier.</p>

                                    <h3>Understanding Formaldehyde</h3>
                                    <p>Formaldehyde is a colorless, strong-smelling gas commonly found indoors. Exposure
                                        can lead to respiratory irritation, allergic reactions, and long-term health
                                        risks, including cancer. The Healthy Climate® In-Duct Air Purifier effectively
                                        removes formaldehyde and other indoor air pollutants, ensuring a healthier
                                        indoor environment for you and your family.</p>
