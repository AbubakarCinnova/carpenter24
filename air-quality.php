                                    <h2>Indoor Air Quality</h2>
                                    <p>Did you know the U.S. EPA has estimated that indoor air levels of pollutants
                                        may
                                        be 2 to 5 times - and occasionally more than 100 times - higher than outdoor
                                        air
                                        pollutant levels. Indoor air pollutants have been ranked among the top five
                                        environmental risks to public health. The problems they cause can be subtle
                                        and
                                        do not always produce easily recognized or immediate impacts on health.
                                        (source
                                        U.S. E.P.A.) The average adult at rest inhales and exhales around 7 or 8
                                        liters
                                        of air per minute. That totals to be around 11,000 liters of air (388 cubic
                                        feet) in a day. So it's important that air you and your family breathe in
                                        your
                                        home be clear of pollutants.</p><br>

                                    <p>New homes and some older homes can be tightly built to save energy, but this
                                        can
                                        often times have a negative impact on homes without proper ventilation. An
                                        airtight home, provides no way to refresh the indoor environment. An ideal
                                        solution for tightly sealed homes is a Health Climate Energy Recovery
                                        Ventilator
                                        (ERV). The ERV system exchanges stale air from inside with fresher outdoor
                                        air.
                                        To ensure absolute comfort, the system captures heat from contaminated air
                                        before it is moved outdoors.</p>
